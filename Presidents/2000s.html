                    In his memoir Dreams from My Father (1995), Obama describes the complexities of discovering his identity in adolescence. After two years at 
                    Occidental College in Los Angeles, he transferred to Columbia University, where he studied political science and international relations. Following graduation in 1983, 
                    Obama worked in New York City, then became a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago, coordinating with churches to improve housing conditions and set up job-training 
                    programs in a community hit hard by steel mill closures. In 1988, he went to Harvard Law School, where he attracted national attention as the first African American president 
                    of the Harvard Law Review. Returning to Chicago, he joined a small law firm specializing in civil rights.
