                <p1> Key Accomplishments: 
                    Territorial Expansion: Polk's presidency is most remembered for its significant expansion of U.S. territory. 
                    He oversaw the annexation of Texas and the Oregon Territory, as well as the acquisition of vast lands from Mexico through the Mexican-American War. 
                    This expansion solidified the concept of Manifest Destiny, the belief that the United States was destined to expand across North America.
                    Tariff Reduction: Polk advocated for a reduction in tariffs, which he believed would benefit the American economy. He successfully pushed through legislation that lowered tariffs, 
                    reducing the federal government's revenue but stimulating domestic manufacturing and trade.
                    Independent Treasury System: Polk established the Independent Treasury System, which separated the government's finances from the banking system.
